# How Cigarettes Work: From Combustion to Physiological Effects

Cigarettes function through a complex interplay of physical design, chemical processes, and biological interactions. During smoking, tobacco combustion releases nicotine and thousands of other compounds that rapidly enter the bloodstream through the lungs, with nicotine reaching the brain within seconds to trigger dopamine release and create pleasurable sensations. This overview examines the intricate mechanisms of cigarette function, from their physical composition to the physiological effects that contribute to their addictive properties.

## Physical Structure and Components

Cigarettes are engineered products consisting of several key components working together to deliver nicotine efficiently. The primary elements include tobacco, cigarette paper, filters, and various additives that modify both the smoking experience and chemical composition of the smoke.

### Tobacco and Additives

The tobacco blend forms the core component of cigarettes, often supplemented with numerous chemical additives. According to documentation released in 1994, American tobacco companies reported up to 599 potential additives that could be used in cigarette production[5]. These additives serve various purposes, including flavor enhancement, burn modification, and potentially affecting nicotine delivery. Among these additives, ammonia-forming compounds have received particular attention for their potential role in enhancing nicotine transfer from tobacco to smoke[6]. While not every cigarette contains all possible additives, the complex chemical composition significantly influences the smoking experience and the properties of the resulting smoke.

### Filters and Design Evolution

Cigarette filters were introduced in the early 1950s and became widespread by the 1960s, with filtered cigarettes dominating the market (increasing from 0.5% in 1950 to 87.7% by 1975)[3]. Modern filters are typically made from plastic cellulose acetate fiber, paper, or activated charcoal, designed to reduce harmful chemicals inhaled during smoking[3]. The filter may use different mechanisms to modify smoke: particle retention through filtration for the particulate smoke phase, and adsorption by finely divided carbon for the gaseous phase[3]. Despite these design features, filters have proven ineffective at removing low molecular weight gases such as carbon monoxide, and their actual harm reduction capacity when smoked by humans (rather than testing machines) remains questionable[3].

## The Chemistry of Cigarette Burning

The burning of a cigarette involves sophisticated chemical processes that transform solid tobacco into inhalable smoke containing thousands of compounds, including nicotine.

### Combustion Zones and Temperature Gradients

When a cigarette burns, it creates a receding burning front with a temperature of approximately 450°C, dividing the cigarette into two distinct zones: the burning zone and the pyrolysis zone[2]. The burning zone reaches temperatures between 600-850°C during smoldering, where high-temperature char combustion occurs[2]. Oxygen participates in these reactions through diffusion and natural convection. Behind the paper char line lies the pyrolysis zone, where heat transferred from the burning zone causes moisture in the tobacco to evaporate while the tobacco undergoes a series of pyrolysis reactions, continuously converting into volatile and semi-volatile smoke components and char[2].

### Puffing vs. Smoldering Processes

Cigarette burning alternates between two distinct processes: puffing (active smoking) and interpuff smoldering[2]. During smoldering, hot gas flows out of the burning zone near the paper char line at approximately 350°C[2]. As this gas suddenly cools, semi-volatiles and some volatiles condense to form sidestream smoke aerosol-smoke that enters the environment directly from the burning cigarette[7]. The relatively long contact times between incoming air and the burning coal during smoldering may allow chemical reactions to reach a steady state[2].

During puffing, the smoker's inhalation draws air through the cigarette, causing hot gases generated in the burning zone to flow through the tobacco column[2]. This airflow heats the tobacco ahead of the burning zone and carries pyrolysis and distillation products to form mainstream smoke-what the smoker inhales directly[2]. The shorter contact time between air and the burning coal during puffing creates different chemical conditions compared to smoldering, resulting in different smoke composition[2].

## Nicotine Delivery System

The primary purpose of cigarettes is to deliver nicotine efficiently to the smoker's bloodstream and brain. This delivery system relies on specific chemical and physical properties of nicotine and how it interacts with the human respiratory system.

### Forms of Nicotine and Absorption

Nicotine exists in cigarette smoke in different forms that affect its absorption rate. The two primary forms are free base nicotine (unionized) and protonated nicotine (ionized)[4]. Free base nicotine more easily crosses biological membranes in the respiratory tract, leading to faster absorption, while protonated forms have shown higher peak plasma concentrations in some studies[4]. The pH of tobacco and smoke plays a critical role in determining the ratio between these forms, with higher pH favoring the free base form[4].

The actual mechanism of nicotine absorption follows the "pH partition hypothesis" of drug absorption, wherein unionized molecules more readily penetrate biological membranes[4]. In the lungs, nicotine absorption occurs through both simple diffusion and carrier-mediated transport, with in vitro studies suggesting that a proton-coupled antiporter may serve as a transporter for nicotine[4].

### Role of Additives in Nicotine Delivery

Certain additives, particularly ammonia-forming compounds, may enhance nicotine delivery by altering the chemical state of nicotine in cigarette smoke[6]. Research has examined how these compounds might affect the transfer of nicotine from tobacco to smoke, although the precise mechanisms and effectiveness remain subjects of scientific investigation[6]. The tobacco industry has historically manipulated the chemistry of cigarettes to optimize nicotine delivery, with techniques including modifying the pH to increase the proportion of free base nicotine[4].

## Physiological Effects and Addiction Pathway

Once inhaled, cigarette smoke rapidly delivers nicotine and other compounds into the body, triggering both immediate and long-term physiological responses.

### Rapid Delivery to the Brain

The lungs provide an enormous surface area for absorption, enabling extremely efficient delivery of nicotine to the bloodstream. After inhalation, nicotine enters the pulmonary venous blood circulation and reaches the brain through arterial circulation in just 10-20 seconds[4]. This rapid delivery is a key factor in cigarettes' addictive potential, as the quick onset of effects strengthens the association between smoking behavior and pleasurable sensations.

### Neurochemical Interactions

In the brain, nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, primarily those composed of α4 and β2 subunits, which have high affinity for nicotine[4]. This binding triggers the release of various neurotransmitters, most notably dopamine[4]. Dopamine plays a critical role in generating pleasurable feelings and activating reward pathways, establishing the neurochemical basis for nicotine addiction[4]. The repeated stimulation of these pathways through regular smoking reinforces the behavior and contributes to dependence.

## Mainstream and Sidestream Smoke

Cigarette smoking produces two distinct types of smoke, each with different compositions and health implications.

### Smoke Composition and Environmental Impact

Mainstream smoke is what the smoker directly inhales through the cigarette during puffing[2]. Its composition is affected by multiple factors, including tobacco components, coal temperature, and filter characteristics[2]. In contrast, sidestream smoke is emitted directly from the burning cigarette into the surrounding air[7]. Sidestream smoke constitutes approximately 85% of second-hand smoke or Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS)[7]. The chemical composition of sidestream smoke differs from mainstream smoke due to the different combustion conditions during smoldering versus puffing[2][7].

Of the more than 7,000 chemicals identified in tobacco smoke, at least 250 are known to be harmful, including hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, and ammonia[5]. Among these harmful chemicals, at least 69 can cause cancer[5]. While filters were introduced to reduce exposure to these toxic compounds, laboratory testing shows they're primarily effective at reducing particulate matter ("tar") and nicotine but ineffective at removing low molecular weight gases like carbon monoxide[3].

## Conclusion

Cigarettes function through a sophisticated interplay of physical design, chemical processes, and biological interactions. The burning cigarette creates a complex chemical reactor that generates mainstream smoke for the user to inhale and sidestream smoke that enters the environment. The primary active compound, nicotine, is delivered rapidly to the brain where it triggers dopamine release and establishes addictive patterns. Despite design modifications like filters that attempt to reduce harm, cigarettes continue to deliver thousands of harmful compounds to both smokers and the surrounding environment.

The effectiveness of cigarettes as nicotine delivery devices stems from their ability to generate an aerosol containing optimally-sized particles that reach deep into the lungs, the specific chemical forms of nicotine that maximize absorption, and the rapid delivery to the brain that creates a tight association between the behavior and the neurochemical reward. This engineered efficiency in delivering an addictive substance explains both their widespread use and the difficulty many experience when trying to quit.
