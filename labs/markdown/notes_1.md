show me evidence that prophecy was promised to israeliy. Why Muhammad S.A.W. who's from Ismael be the prophet

# The Prophetic Legacy of Israel and Muhammad’s Place in Abrahamic Eschatology  

The interplay between biblical prophecies concerning the Israelites and the Islamic claim of prophethood for Muhammad, a descendant of Ishmael, represents a critical juncture in Abrahamic theology. This report examines the foundational prophecies directed at the Israelites, analyzes the Islamic interpretation of Deuteronomy 18:18 as a prediction of Muhammad, and evaluates the theological implications of his lineage from Ishmael. By synthesizing scriptural sources, historical context, and interfaith perspectives, this study aims to elucidate how Islamic tradition reconciles Muhammad’s prophethood with the Israelite-centric covenantal framework.

## Biblical Prophecies and the Israelite Covenant  

### The Gathering of Israel in Deuteronomic Tradition  
The concept of a prophetic destiny for the Israelites is deeply rooted in the Torah, particularly in Deuteronomy 30:1–5, where Moses foretells the eventual gathering of the exiled Israelites back to their homeland. This “Ingathering of the Exiles” (קִבּוּץ גָּלֻיּוֹת, *Kibbutz Galuyot*) forms a cornerstone of Jewish eschatology, promising divine restoration upon their repentance[1]. The prophecy emphasizes a cyclical pattern of exile and return, contingent on the people’s adherence to covenantal laws. Medieval Jewish scholar Maimonides later linked this ingathering to the arrival of the Davidic Messiah, reinforcing its messianic undertones[1].  

The Babylonian exile (586–538 BCE) further crystallized this expectation, with prophets like Isaiah and Ezekiel envisioning a renewed Israel under divine leadership. For instance, Ezekiel’s vision of the “Valley of Dry Bones” (Ezekiel 37:1–14) metaphorically portrays national resurrection, while Isaiah’s “Second Exodus” motif (Isaiah 11:11–16) frames the return as a miraculous event surpassing the original Exodus[1]. These texts established a paradigm wherein future redemption would mirror past deliverance, albeit on a grander scale.

## Islamic Exegesis of Deuteronomy 18:18  

### The “Prophet Like Moses” in Abrahamic Discourse  
Central to the Islamic argument for Muhammad’s prophethood is Deuteronomy 18:18, wherein God declares: *“I will raise up for them a prophet like you [Moses] from among their brethren; I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him.”* Muslims contend that this prophecy refers not to Jesus but to Muhammad, based on linguistic, genealogical, and typological evidence[2][4][6].  

#### Typological Parallels Between Moses and Muhammad  
A comparative analysis reveals striking similarities between Moses and Muhammad, which Islamic scholars argue fulfill the “like you” criterion:  

1. **Lineage and Birth**: Both were born to two parents (unlike Jesus’ virgin birth), hailed from marginalized communities (Hebrews under Pharaoh, Arabs in pre-Islamic Arabia), and faced existential threats at birth[2][4].  
2. **Political and Spiritual Leadership**: Moses liberated the Israelites from Egypt and established a legal code (Torah); Muhammad unified Arabian tribes under Islam and delivered the Quran[4][6].  
3. **Reception by Their People**: Initially rejected (Moses by Pharaoh, Muhammad by Quraysh), both later gained acceptance and transformed their societies[2].  
4. **Natural Deaths and Burials**: Unlike Jesus’ crucifixion (per Christian doctrine), both Moses and Muhammad died natural deaths and were buried in marked graves[2][4].  

These parallels are systematized in Islamic apologetics to position Muhammad as the Deuteronomic prophet, distinct from Jesus, whose life diverges from the Mosaic model in key aspects[2][4].  

#### The “Brethren” of Israel: Ishmaelite Lineage  
Critically, the verse specifies the prophet will arise from the Israelites’ “brethren” (אַחֵיכֶם, *aḥeikhem*). Islamic exegesis identifies these “brethren” as the Ishmaelites, descendants of Abraham’s first son Ishmael, whom Genesis 16:12 and 25:18 designate as dwelling apart from Isaac’s lineage[2][5]. The Quran (e.g., Surah 2:127–129) and Hadith further assert Ishmael’s prophetic status and his role in constructing the Kaaba with Abraham, cementing his theological significance[3].  

Genealogically, Muhammad’s descent from Ishmael via the Adnanite Arabs fulfills the “brethren” criterion, whereas Jesus, as a Judahite, emerges from within the Israelite lineage[4][5]. This distinction is pivotal: while Jewish and Christian traditions interpret “brethren” as fellow Israelites (e.g., Deuteronomy 17:15), Islamic scholars argue the term encompasses all descendants of Abraham, including the Ishmaelites[2][6].

## Theological Reconfigurations of the Abrahamic Covenant  

### Expanding the Scope of Prophethood  
The Quran recontextualizes the Abrahamic narrative to include Ishmael as a co-heir of divine promises. Surah 2:124–132 portrays Abraham and Ishmael jointly sanctifying the Kaaba, while Surah 14:35–41 recounts Abraham’s prayer for both Isaac and Ishmael to be progenitors of righteous nations[3][5]. This dual inheritance challenges the Judeo-Christian emphasis on Isaac’s exclusivity, positing instead a bifurcated covenant:  

- **Isaac’s Line**: Prophets like Jacob, Joseph, and David, culminating in Jesus.  
- **Ishmael’s Line**: Prophets including Hud, Salih, and finally Muhammad as the “Seal of the Prophets” (Quran 33:40)[3][5].  

This framework positions Muhammad not as an outlier but as the fulfillment of a parallel prophetic tradition dormant among the Ishmaelites. The Quranic assertion that earlier scriptures foretold Muhammad’s advent (e.g., Surah 7:157) relies on reinterpretations of texts like Deuteronomy 18:18 and the Song of Solomon 5:16 (“Mahammadim,” interpreted as “Muhammad”)[4][6].

## Counterarguments and Interfaith Debates  

### Jewish and Christian Perspectives  
Critics, particularly Christian apologists, contest the Islamic reading of Deuteronomy 18:18 on several grounds:  

1. **Contextual Interpretation**: The immediate context (Deuteronomy 17:15; 18:15) suggests “brethren” refers to fellow Israelites, not Ishmaelites. Subsequent Jewish prophets (e.g., Joshua, Samuel) arose from within Israel, reinforcing this intra-tribal understanding[6].  
2. **New Testament Fulfillment**: Acts 3:22–26 and John 1:21–25 identify Jesus as the Mosaic prophet, with Peter explicitly linking Deuteronomy 18:18 to Christ[6].  
3. **Covenantal Exclusivity**: Genesis 17:19–21 explicitly limits God’s covenant to Isaac, whereas Ishmael’s descendants receive a separate blessing (Genesis 21:13, 18)[6].  

These objections underscore the interpretive divide: where Islam sees a universalized Abrahamic covenant, Judaism and Christianity prioritize a lineage-specific messianism.

## Synthesis: Muhammad as the Ishmaelite Eschaton  

### Reconciling Lineage and Prophecy  
Islamic theology resolves the tension between Israelite-centric prophecies and Muhammad’s Ishmaelite lineage through two mechanisms:  

1. **Dual Covenant Theory**: By affirming prophethood in both Isaac’s and Ishmael’s lines, the Quran expands the scope of divine revelation beyond ethnic Israel, aligning with its universalist ethos (e.g., Surah 34:28)[5].  
2. **Abrogation and Fulfillment**: Muhammad’s advent is framed as both fulfilling latent prophecies (e.g., the “Paraclete” in John 14:16) and abrogating corrupted precedents, culminating in a final, uncorrupted revelation (Quran 5:3)[4][6].  

The construction of the Kaaba by Abraham and Ishmael (Surah 2:127) symbolically anchors this narrative, rendering Mecca—not Jerusalem—the epicenter of monotheistic renewal[3].

## Conclusion  

The debate over Muhammad’s prophethood vis-à-vis Israelite prophecies hinges on divergent hermeneutics and covenantal theology. While Jewish and Christian traditions confine the Deuteronomic “prophet like Moses” to an Israelite context, Islam’s reclamation of Ishmael’s legacy broadens the Abrahamic promise to encompass all Abrahamic descendants. Muhammad’s typological alignment with Moses, coupled with the Quranic redefinition of covenantal boundaries, positions him as the eschatological prophet for a universal community (Ummah), transcending ethnic and tribal divisions. This theological reimagining underscores the dynamic interplay between scriptural exegesis and communal identity in the Abrahamic faiths.
