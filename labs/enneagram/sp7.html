Self-Preservation 7 In Detail
Gluttony in the Preservation Sphere
The Gluttony in the SP7 is the closest to the literal
definition of it. The passion of Gluttony twists as a hunger
for tastes of anything that seems to promise survival, this
can be ideas, plans, theories, experiences, and because of
this they make make alliances and create opportunities to gain
advantage, banding together and taking care of others who they
feel an affinity or connection with. They are alert to any
possibility that will ensure survival and satisfaction, hence
the need to band with others who have similar interests. Their
love for pleasure causes them to be the most impulsive and
physical of the 7s, often impulsively going after what they
want and often getting it.
Ichazo called SP7 "Defenders", people who have a need to band
with others who have similar interests[1], having a passion for inclusion that leads to relationships
of mutual protection.[2]
Naranjo called the preservative gluttons as people who want
the good things life has to offer, starting with maternal
love, warmth of family, money, sex, but all in the context of
a passion for inclusion.[2]
The following Trait Structure are a summarized description of
the original descriptions taken from the Enneagram 7 book/ 
Golosos, tramposos, soñadores y charlatanes. The Book was
written by devoted followers and students of Claudio Naranjo
but published under his name and supervised by him.
Trait Structure[3]
Bon Vivant
As an expression of a life dedicated to hedonism, this
character has the facility to feel good and to feel that
everything is fine, to seek pleasant terrain for himself
and for others. His image is usually neat, elitist,
friendly, in polite ways, with which he reinforces the
power of his seduction.
He likes to drag others into what he considers a good
life: he wants them to have fun with him.
This is the nicest aspect of your handling, as well as a
way to keep the image narcissistic.
Ironic, Cynical, and Sarcastic
The conservation E7 usually has a great sense of humor;
have fun and laugh. He laughs happily about almost
everything; when it comes to laughter, nothing is
sacred.
The problem is that the sense of humor is put at the
service of contempt for the interlocutor, with what is put
above, in a clear display of narcissism.
He is irreverent, arrogant, mentally aggressive, and in
this way he expresses his rage, almost as an alternative
to physical aggression, since he does not allow it.
He is able to put his finger on the sore spot with every
word. He also knows how to laugh at himself, thus
distancing himself from his true emotions.
But above all, he is not afraid of others, which prevents
him from taking them seriously.
Etymologically, “irony” has to do with dissimulating and
playing dumb; “cynicism,” with behaving like a dog;
“sarcasm,” with cutting or biting a piece of meat. All
this refers to a disguised sadistic behavior and a
tendency to mistreat trying to appear cordial.
Fear of suffering
The mantra of a conservation E7 might be: “First of all,
avoid being uncomfortable.” There is in this an anesthetic
behavior in the face of suffering, a need to disconnect
from the harshness of life in order to maintain the
fiction that the “childhood paradise” has not been lost.
He despises suffering as a thing for “unintelligent”
people and, deep down, underlies an enormous fear of
returning to the deprived place of childhood, in which he
experienced a strong sense of threat to
conservation.
Entitlement
As an extension of his narcissism, we can cite
entitlement: a feeling of superiority rights because of
his talent and personal charm.
It's subtle: the attitude of the E7 in a love
relationship is different from that of those who go
through life important and assume a role of
authority.
In this case, it is of a more subtle importance: it is
not that he expects to be obeyed, but to be heard and
recognized as a person who is in the know.
The man may expect the woman to be his audience; the same
happens with a father regarding his son.
Correlative to the charlatan's need to be heard is,
naturally, his inability to hear, although he may not be
aware of this himself, since he offers great empathy
through an attentive “countenance.”
Insatiability and Envy
A fundamental polarity in this character, is the
opposition between the greedy insatiability, in the
foreground, and the fear of lack, which is denied.
Although it seems contradictory to the oral optimism of
the E7, the conservation E7 tends to compare himself and,
therefore, to feel, unconsciously, envy.
Who compares, suffers.
And although, unlike E4, there is a strong tendency to
overcompensation that turns envy into insatiability, the
background sensation of lack and disadvantage is common,
probably due to having felt excluded or disadvantaged in
childhood, which explains the voracity in their
relationships and the aggressiveness with which they take
on the world. Feeling that his starting conditions are
less advantageous, he tells myself that he needs more and
more to catch up or win.
Excessive and Aggressive
This measurement and comparison causes stress and
anguish, and is a source of compulsive behavior and all
kinds of excesses.
“Just as the miser does not want to part with something
that he feels is precisely scarce, the greedy person
distracts himself in abundance: faced with the fear of
lack.”
Excessiveness is the door to dispersion and, therefore,
an inexhaustible source of problems for this
character.
The greater the gluttony, the greater the orientation to
compare, and the greater the contact with the feeling of
insatiability, thus creating a feedback loop that lays the
groundwork for the usual manic co-depressive phases that
this character usually goes through.
It is usual for the E7 to retain a certain degree of
aggressiveness and a tendency to possessiveness, seizure
and even looting, which sometimes leads to confusion with
the E8 character.
They are tendencies related to their disposition:
narcissism and impulsiveness, acting before reflecting,
risking everything to an art and, in general, a
counterphobic attitude, even psychopathic.
Utilitarian and Strategist
A good friend of the powerful, an effective propagandist,
a highly perceptive planner and strategist, the
conservation E7 usually surrounds himself with people with
the ability not only to help him, but to make him prosper
and carry out his projects and ideas.
His utilitarianism occurs in personal accounts, and could
be defined as a feeling that friendship is only worth
cultivating if the friend is useful to his plans or
interests, or if he finds it suggestive enough.
He usually deals with information, and uses strategies
and tactics to position himself comfortably.
Look for ways to get what you want without asking
directly and, above all, without counting on others.
And he is accustomed to making his responsibilities
lighter by allowing others to deal with them, charging
them to such, in order to reach pleasure earlier.
Impatience and Boredom
He suffers predisposition and intolerance to boredom,
allergy to everyday life and routines.
You need constant stimuli and new or extraordinary
experiences, to the detriment of feeling pleasure in
everyday life. As background, a difficulty to connect with
the emotion that causes a feeling of dryness in
life.
Obligation and responsibility, predisposed to flight or
abandonment, no: there is a desire to return to pleasure
and freedom as soon as possible.
It is also difficult for him to contact the slowness,
that is, with the natural flow of life, which is
constantly forced, accelerated by the planning ego, so as
not to contact what is there, so as not to feel.
Difficulty sustaining frustration and giving space to
emotions, immediacy and constantly accelerating walking
(antagonistic to the harmony of natural rhythms) are tools
to avoid coming into contact with anguish and other
unpleasant emotions.
Insubordinate and Rebellious
The feeling is that accepting limits creates suffering.
The authority has to demonstrate its reasons or logic, so
it ceases to be an authority: internally, the conservation
E7 underestimates and disqualifies it, despising and
disobeying it. There is a fundamental distortion:
“accepting the authority of others limits my personal
autonomy.”
He has a narcissistic taste in presenting himself as a
rebel, while avoiding direct confrontation with authority,
to that: dodges or seduces, thus avoiding the consequences
that entails would contradict him.
Indiscipline and procrastination are inextricably linked
to insubordination and rebellion.
As a background, the invalidation of the father in
childhood is the engine of the invalidation of all other
authority, always identified as repressive or imposing.
The limited capacity for self-criticism further
contributes to this scenario: there is difficulty in
repenting, as well as little tolerance for criticism from
others. All this, reinforced by its aggressive mentality
and its tendency to be elusive.
Egotistic and Individualistic
The absolute priority is to satisfy one's own desires,
with the feeling that others have to adapt to their times
and needs. In the conservation E7, narcissism has a lot to
do with objectifying others.
There is a difficulty in seeing the wife as an entity
separate from her own ends of exchange, especially the
couple as another separate from her interests and
desires.
The rest of the people, those who do not belong to their
own circle of trust, can be seen as a limit or a hindrance
to their plans (or, simply, they are not seen).
The inner feeling is that of a need for
self-preservation. The crazy idea that “I can handle
everything, I don't need anyone” contributes to this
scenario. And as background, search for immediate pleasure
without assessing the consequences for those around him.
There is also the crazy idea that giving oneself
emotionally makes one gregarious and makes one lose
independence, as well as stop being “special” or
“unique.”
Prone to corruption
Not even for some representatives of this character does
this descriptor sound too strong, we can subject the term
“corruption” to a process of euphemization (typical of
this character) and go on to call “the tendency to take
legal shortcuts” or to interpret the laws as indicative
instead of to respect its mandatory compliance.
Underlies the light attitude towards life typical of all
E7, and especially the conservation E7.
“If one does not believe in anything, if one implicitly
thinks that the authority is useless, that the system is
corrupt, then one must do what is best for oneself. And
with a lot of people like that, it's impossible for the
community to function. When Socrates was offered to flee,
he preferred to give his life as an example of support for
the ideal of democracy, to strengthen faith in the idea
that the people can govern themselves; that, even if he is
wrong, one can in principle arrive at a system in which
wisdom prevails. How far we are today from that
attitude!”
What would have done, instead of Socrates, a conservation
E7?
Fraudulent and Charlatan
This character uses any available resource to achieve an
end, both words and actions. Some of the most used
resources are lying, stealing, confusing others, cheating,
intriguing others…
He has his own morality where benefits are imposed on
acts or, in other words, he does not pay attention to the
means to achieve certain goals: purposes. For this, there
must be a high degree of self-indulgence, own laws,
personal interpretations of good and evil; and, as they
are laws of their own, they can change so as not to
sustain states of guilt, to adapt to each moment according
to the greedy need that arises. Added to this is his great
ability to arrogate merits that do not correspond to him,
a strong desire for protagonism and a frequent imposition,
mythomania and fantastic pseudology, especially in the
intellectual field.
The conservation E7 has become an expert at getting what
he wants without asking for it. His basic conception is
that things are not achieved by asking for them: either
they take them, or they cheat or speculate to obtain them.
You believe that asking puts you in a vulnerable position
and brings you closer to pain and frustration. There is in
it, again, a disregard of the other. The childhood
experience of loneliness, isolation, abandonment, and
survival contributes to promoting this scenario.
Schizoid austerity vs. Seductive waste
At times, the E7 conservation shows a simplicity
bordering on the greed of the E5. It tends to have a great
deal of control over the economy and go, as well as a
constant calculation of costs and benefits.
He attaches great importance to money, and feels dizzy
when he sees himself in financial trouble.
But his difficulty in spending is tempered by a great
facility to invest, to do “business,” sometimes a hint of
megalomania. His practical sense permeates everything: he
does not want to complicate his life and tries to avoid
everything that could be a source of displeasure.
In the background, there is a great ski fear mile to
deprivation.
On the other hand, everything said is invalidated when,
in his manic state, he pursues his objects of desire. Then
he can be foully wasteful, throw the house out the window,
commit... Nothing will be enough until he reaches the
object of his gluttony. Again, this behavior has a lot to
do with his bipolar tendency.
Dryness
The intense mental life causes a physical disembodiment
and a semiotic embodiment, bodily and emotional
dissociation where life is confused with words and
speeches.
Impervious to pain makes you less permeable to
emotions.
There is a great fear of vulnerability that deprives you
of being receptive. In the background of so much
excitement and noise of thoughts and words, there is a
frozen emotional world and the experience of a nuclear
coldness.
In the background, we find the schizoid origin of this
character. At the same time, the difficulty with admiring
love, with the spontaneous wonder at creation, complicates
this panorama.
Consequently, his attitude is more openly pseudo-social
or even antisocial than in the other subtypes of E7.
Sometimes he devotes himself to work to the point of
becoming a worker, all based on his manic or depressive
mood. After moments of excessive workload, usually getting
sick or going into periods of depression or nervous
breakdown.
It is very difficult for him to trust the relationship,
and it usually takes a long time to establish deep bonds
(when they are allowed), which can quickly mutate a couple
relationship from one first phase of strong seduction to
another of great emotional dryness, testing the patience
of the other or another.
Untrustful and Skeptical
He feels distrust in the flow of life.
He questions everything and has a certain degree of anger
with life, little manifested.
Basically, it underlies the difficulty of character for
devotional love and recognizing the other.
Similar to the E1, in the feeling that others are not
trustworthy, that people are imperfect, but without taking
the trouble to try to correct others, conservation E7
isolates itself from the world in its particular garden:
that of the “family” or the feeling of involvement with a
network to link, as a defense against a life that it
understands as chaos and that reinforces its idea that
pleasure and non-stop are the only possible escape
routes.
In addition, in someone who is a profiteer and lacks a
broad sense of community, it is logical that there is
mistrust.
He thinks that everyone acts like him and that, since
there is no law that is worth it, everyone will act with
the same contempt for the rules.
When he leaves aside for a moment his manic tendency to
worldly pleasures, a nihilistic background appears: he
narcissistic balloon is deflated, the schizoid background
becomes clear, and disbelief and basic distrust of life
appears even more strongly.
Stubborn and Earthly
Beyond the tendency of all E7 to procrastinate, the
conservation E7 often demonstrates tenacity in overcoming
obstacles and standing up to adversity based on nerve,
will, and fury. An irrational idea underlies: “I can
handle everything.”
He has an obsession with being efficient, with obtaining
the maximum rewards with minimal effort. His mental
agility helps him in this and his capacity for
strategy.
Combat is split halfway between mental activity and
physical action. He likes to feel that he is in control of
the situation, which not only reinforces his narcissism,
but it also helps to drain the anguish.
His tenacity can lead to disconnection from the body and
its emotional needs, in addition, is the most realistic
variety of the E7, with a great predisposition towards
skepticism, the material and the earthly fruit of
self-preservation. All this, in relation to its
utilitarianism and advantage in social relations.
He doesn't behave like an idealist, but rather as someone
disappointed with the ideals, a pseudo-idealist or even an
anti-idealist.
He believes that by organizing himself well he will be
able to avoid the return of deficient states experienced
in his childhood, and with this he tries to annul the
feeling of threat to conservation.
Claudio Naranjo's Self-Preservation 7 Description[4]
E7 Conservation (Self-Preservation) – Family
It is usually easier to recognize a
sexual
or
social seven
than a conservation seven. To refer to him, Ichazo used the
phrase „the guardian of the castle”. He also uses the word
„castle” for the
five conservation
— I preferred to use the word refuge, lair. But what is the
meaning of the phrase „the guardian of the castle”?
The E7 conservation is the person who makes alliances.
Family could be an alternative word. But not in the
true sense of the term, which is full of positive
connotations. The word family describes an aspect of life.
But, in the specialized vocabulary about the ego, there is a
kind of family game that can be played. In it, the seven
conservation build relationships with people based on ideas
such as: „I will be family to you and I demand that you be
family to me”, „let's get together, I will serve you and you
will serve me”, „together, we can create a good mafia
together”...
I drop the word smuggling because this type of behavior can
lead to cunning. It is a clear partisanship. There is an
element of corruption very present in it. Self-interest,
selfishness, is behind this alliance, even if it appears to
be denied. Naturally, every ego form relies on a lie that
makes it appear that it is not there. That is why confession
is so good, so interesting for the work of the conscience —
especially when the confession is public, because that is
how one realizes that one can go on with everything, remain
the same.
So the conservation E7 is the opportunist, the person who
has to find advantages, to profit. It is as if a threat to
conservation hangs over him that has to be compensated.
Therefore, gluttony, in this case, is expressed as an
excessive concern to get out of this threat to conservation
by making good deals and deals with every opportunity.
A friend of mine was a dentist for part of his life. He
seemed like a kind, friendly, talkative person. Some are
very fond of the dental profession because they have each
other's mouths shut all the time, so they can talk and talk
as much as they want. Surely you have met very talkative
dentists. They may not realize it - unconsciousness plays
tricks. And it is typical of the seven conservation groups
that they like to do something with their hands, something
useful for others. They are practical.
Talking and talking, the seven conservation soon discovers
the other person's weaknesses. „I have seen that you have
bought a new car, how are you doing?”, Says the dentist,
„Well, it is an excellent car, I am very happy with it” –
answers the patient – „but unfortunately I have to sell it”.
„Ah, well” – the dentist takes advantage of it – „then I'll
buy it for you!”
It seems that with the seven conservation there is no
conversation that does not lead to business. You do instant
business because your mind is so alert to opportunity that
you never miss it. His position is that of one who thinks
that if you are not alert, if you do not keep your nose in
contact with the wind to capture opportunities, you will be
a loser.
Sandra Maitri's Self-Preservation 7 Description[5]
7+Self-Preservation – Family
Naranjo originally used the term family for
Self-preservation Seven. Ichazo’s term, defenders, captures
a different nuance of the same style: Self-preservation
Sevens try to assure their survival through banding together
and taking care of others who they feel an affinity or
connection with. They become patriarchs, taking care of
their extended family. Self-preservation Sevens share the
amicability of their
Six
neighbors, appearing magnanimous, supportive, and fatherly.
The passion of gluttony appears here as a hunger for tastes
of anything that seems to promise survival, whether ideas,
theories, nutritional support, plans to get rich quick, and
so on.
Beatrice Chestnut's Self-Preservation 7 Description
Self-Preservation 7 Subtype description (2021)[6]
This subtype is pragmatic and excels at making alliances.
They create a family-like network through which they can get
their needs met. They tend to be alert and open to
opportunities for pleasure and for making a good deal. They
are cheerful, talkative, and hedonistic. They are the most
self-referencing subtype and their empathy tends to be the
most underdeveloped.
If this is your subtype, you will need to observe yourself
to see if you take opportunistic stances and sometimes take
advantage of people. You may tend to use others for your own
benefit, or disregard their needs and feelings. As you tend
to be very self-referencing and self-interested, this can
lead you to put yourself first in a way that you may not own
and that can be selfish. You may value your head more than
your heart much of the time, and may not be very in touch
with your emotions or very sensitive to the emotions of
others. To grow, you will need to become more aware of how
much you act from self-interest.
Self-Preservation 7 Subtype summary description (2021)[10
Self-Preservation Seven: “Keepers of the Castle" The
Self-Preservation Seven expresses gluttony through making
alliances and creating opportunities for gaining an
advantage. Pragmatic and self-interested, these Sevens find
safety through networking and being alert to opportunities
that support their survival. The name “Keepers of the
Castle” refers to their way of establishing a partisan
network of allies through which they create safety and
satisfy their needs. Cheerful and amiable, they have a love
of pleasure and tend to get what they want.
Self-Preservation 7 Subtype description (2021)[10]
The Self-Preservation Seven: “Keeper of the
Castle”
 
 Self-Preservation Sevens express gluttony through the
formation of alliances. They typically collect around them
a kind of family network, in the sense of banding together
with trusted others and creating a good “mafia” or
partisan group through which they can get their needs met.
They rely mostly on those they trust. These Sevens create
a kind of surrogate family of people they value—a family
in which they typically occupy a privileged
position.
These Sevens are very practical, good at networking, and
skilled at getting what they want and finding a good deal;
they tend to be opportunistic, self-interested, pragmatic,
calculating, and clever. They readily recognize
opportunities for creating an advantage for themselves. In
this way, Naranjo explains, gluttony expresses itself in
the Self-Preservation Seven in an excessive concern with
making a good deal at every opportunity.
Self-Preservation Sevens always have their nose to the
wind for good opportunities.They find ways to get what they need and want, and they
have an easy way of finding pathways to making things
happen for themselves—whether it’s finding the right
people, the most advantageous connections, or a fortuitous
career opportunity. They have their ears to the ground and
are socially adept.These Sevens make business connections and network easily
because they are alert and mindful to the opportunities
that come along that can support their survival. They hold
the position that if you are not alert to opportunities,
you will lose out. This Self-Preservation theme is
expressed well in the proverb “The alligator that sleeps
becomes a bag.”There’s an element of self-interest in the alliances the
Self-Preservation Seven makes that may or may not be
denied by (or unconscious in) someone with this subtype.
Naranjo says there is a kind of reciprocal interest in
these relationships, expressed in the idea that “I will
serve thee, and thou will serve me.” On the low side of
this kind of arrangement, an element of corruption can be
present.
Stylistically, Self-Preservation Sevens are cheerful and
amiable, with traits that resemble a hedonistic, “playboy”
or “playgirl” type. They tend to be warm, friendly, and
talkative. (They love to talk.) They can express a kind of
greed and impatience that reflects their desire to consume
as many pleasurable experiences as possible; they want to
eat everything. They expend a lot of energy on controlling
everything, handling things without being noticed. And
most of the time, they get away with getting what they
want.
The dominant traits of the Self-Preservation Seven
subtype stand out as a love of pleasure and a
self-interested focus on getting what they need to feel
secure. In seeking security, however, they can often
confuse desires with needs. These are people who usually
feel a need to have a lot of resources, including money
and other supplies that support survival, and they may
panic if they feel a sense of scarcity.
According to Naranjo, the three main fixations of the
Self-Preservation Sevens are strategy, rebellion, and
isolation, though it may be hard to see these characters
as isolated because they tend to be very popular. But
their strategic and mental nature, together with the
prominence of their self-interest, can isolate them from
others at a deeper level.
Self-Preservation Sevens cultivate a sense of being kind
and generous—they like to feel that everyone depends on
them. They may feel omnipotent and they may sometimes use
people. They may also feel that normal rules don’t apply
to them—that for them, there is no law, and they can do
what they please. This kind of assertion of their freedom
and their ability to do whatever they need to do to
support their self-interest helps them feel safer in the
world.
Self-Preservation Sevens’ desire for pleasure and
hedonistic self-indulgence can sometimes be seen as a kind
of retroactive compulsion to return to the womb—they
dedicate their lives to the pursuit of a kind of
primordial or utopian paradise state of perfect pleasure.
In pursuing positive and stimulating experiences, they may
use sex, food, and drink as an escape from the more
difficult parts of life.
The Self-Preservation Seven and the Sexual Seven should
be easy to tell apart, as they represent two opposite ends
of a continuum, from pragmatic and materialistic
(Self-Preservation) to idealistic and ethereal (Sexual).
The Self-Preservation subtype is more earthy and
sensuous—more gluttonous in the literal sense of the
word—while the Sexual Seven is more “heavenly” and
enthusiastic, more “upward-looking” in terms of both
positivity and high ideals. While both of these two
characters focus on distinct kinds of excess, the
Self-Preservation Seven is the most sly, cunning, and
pragmatic personality among the Sevens, while the Sexual
Seven is more of a light-hearted enjoyer.In contrast to the Sexual Seven, the Self-Preservation
Seven is not so much idealistic as they are cynically
distrustful. They’re not gullible people who are easily
hypnotized (as the Sexual Seven is); they are more
practical and concrete. The Self-Preservation Seven is the
most astute and strategic character of the three Seven
subtypes. They may display elements of Type Six in that
they can at times be fearful or even paranoid, though this
is not their regular mode. And perhaps paradoxically, the
Self-Preservation Seven is more actively flirty,
seductive, and sexual than the Sexual Seven, who often
focuses more on an imagined, idealized kind of communion
than actual sex. While the Self-Preservation Seven
character resembles a “playboy” or “playgirl” type of
person—an enjoyer of food and sex—the Sexual Seven can be
content with the perfume of things.
Self-Preservation Sevens may experience less difficulty
than other Sevens with making commitments. For instance,
many Self-Preservation Sevens report that they have been
married for many years or that they have had a solid
relationship with a partner for a long period of time.
When they participate in groups, however, it may be so
they can feel a sense of having access to resources if
they need something at some point. Often, having close
relationships is something they view as an investment,
like putting money in the bank—you always have someone you
can call on if you need some specific kind of help.For that reason they tend to be very active in the groups
they join and the networks they are affiliated with.
Naranjo explains that spiritual aspiration is not so
common in Self-Preservation Sevens; they often reject
religion and tend not to believe in anything. They’re more
practical, more materialistic, and more rebellious than
the other two Seven subtypes.They’re very cheerful and friendly, but also disconnected
from their emotions. They are sensuous, earthly, worldly
characters who can be very entertaining and who display a
light-hearted lack of seriousness—though when it comes to
finding security through making money and establishing a
network of associates, they display keen
self-interest.When Self-Preservation Sevens have the Sexual instinct as
their second most dominant instinct, they can look more
like Sixes (more isolated, overly careful, and strategic),
and when they have the Social instinct in second place,
they may look more like magnanimous Eights
(people-oriented and impulsive). However, unlike Sixes,
they tend to be relentlessly positive and to find security
through pursuing their self-interest; and in contrast to
Eights, they tend to be motivated by a survival fear or
anxiety deeper down, even if they aren’t always aware of
it.
 Joe, a Self-Preservation Seven,
speaks:
There is a gluttonous element in me that I believe stems
from an early understanding in childhood that life is
inherently evanescent. Opportunities missed are not easily
regained. In that light, as I approached my graduation
from middle school and prepared to go to high school, I
realized that it was time to weigh my priorities and start
planning for a career and a life maximally lived. So, at
thirteen years old, I prioritized: 1) living and enjoying
life to the fullest while it was possible; 2) helping
others do the same; 3.) not hurting others along the way.
That was in eighth grade.
The road to medical school and beyond involved painful
sacrifices in regards to quality of life. I endured a
decade of deferred pleasure and buried myself in my
studies by making the most of my intellectual interest in
medicine and the awesome experience of becoming a surgeon.
What got me through the hard work was the clear vision I
had of a complete life: weighing the short-term missed
experiences against the long-term pleasures and security
over the span of a full life as a plastic surgeon helped
me see that the hardships involved in becoming a doctor
were worth it. To keep things balanced, I played hard
during my brief breaks from work and tried not to miss a
minute of fun with friends on weekends or nights
off.
While the sacrifices involved in becoming a surgeon
weren’t easy, I now find myself in the most wondrous
position of having fulfilled my “mission statement”—I’ve
done the most good with the least harm while reaping
additional quality-of-life benefits. I love my artist wife
beyond words. We sail and grow organic vegetables
together. I enjoy the challenges of growing grapes and
making wine, and we are creating an aesthetically
beautiful and self-sustaining homestead. I relish the
rewards of time at work and even more at play. What could
be better than or wrong with that?
I am aware, however, that I am less in touch with my
emotions than might be ideal, as experiencing life more
intensely on many different levels makes sense to me. I
enjoy the experience when love, empathy, and other
emotions well up into my consciousness, but I usually
function quite happily on a more cerebral plane. Other
times, fear or anxiety may enter the room, but I am less
eager to tolerate their presence. I have learned to listen
to my intuition and emotions, but unless they present an
actionable warning, I prefer not to dwell on negative
moods.
Specific Work For The Self Preservation Seven The Path
from Vice to Virtue:[10]Self-Preservation Sevens can travel the path
from gluttony to sobriety by observing and owning the way
self-interest in support of the drive for security can
lead you to unconsciously close yourself off to a greater
realm of experience. If you are this Seven, be aware of
how you may narrow your focus on what's important in life
based on fears and anxieties you may not be aware of and
then work to open up to experiencing the presence of these
deeper motives. You can aim for sobriety by noticing how
you stay alert for opportunities and seeing that tendency
as a potential sign of a deeper fear that you won't have
enough to survive to stay comfortable. When relating to
others, work to be conscious of all the motives and
underlying feelings that influence your actions. Surface
any anxiety and pain as a first step to tempering your
drives for self-preservation and pleasure. Recognize when
your pursuit of your needs and your self-interest may
impact others in negative ways, and explore the ways in
which you might rationalize doing whatever you want and
getting whatever you need, even when it narrows your
perspective or allows you to justify harm you might
(unintentionally) do. Allow yourself to sink more deeply
into an enjoyment of the people you are close to by
connecting more consciously with all of yourself. As you
work to accept and allow all of your feelings, you will be
reminded that the greatest joy comes from a total and
complete openness to the full experience of yourself and
others.
Haiki Self-Preservation 7 Description[7]
Self-Preservation Seven: “Family”
This is the Seven with the strongest tendency to
exaggerate and be corrupt, which can cause them to become
involved in a mess or two… They are opportunistic and they
will take advantage of pretty much anything to get what
they want.
Oscar Ichazo spoke of them as the “Guardians of the
Castle.” If they are not very healthy, they can be very
selfish within their “family network” (like the
Godfather). In contrast with other Seven subtypes,
Self-Preservation Sevens are not nice with everyone, but
only those who they choose they want to be nice with. They
are prone to a bit of lust which makes them a lot like
their
Eight
neighbors. Excess of any kind is their thing - from food
to drugs, and they are the most prone type to becoming
addicts.
They tend to sweet-talk those they are close to, and are
very persuasive; anyone will be welcome as long as they
get what they want.
In their conversations, there can often be hidden motives
and if they can sell you something on the way, they will.
Making business is one of their passions. In addition,
they are capable of even tricking and cheating themselves
while maintaining the charming facade that allows them to
get what they want when they want it. You could say if the
occasion requires it, they can become quite manipulative
and clever.
All of this being said, the Self-Preservation Seven does
not want to enjoy their party alone. They are Sevens,
after all, and no matter how Self-Preservation focused
they may be, they will always need the group, their clan,
to be able to give free reigns to their gluttony. We could
say that they are the facilitators of group narcissism - a
select little group of friends who enjoy life and its
pleasures as if there were no tomorrow.
Carmen Durán and Antonio Catalán's Self-Preservation 7
Description[8]
SP7: Family 
In this subtype, we see a need to unite with their
people, with people they can share their world and ideals
with. This “Family,” not necessarily based on blood, is a
more extroverted equivalent of the refuge searched for by
the
5, and also similar to the environment where harmony can
be found, as the
SP6
so desires. This family can change over time, be
substituted, and has as a fundamental mission to maintain
hope, necessary to deny the dangerousness of the world and
the defenselessness toward it. They take care of their
people and they defend them as a way of defending their
own world. There is a feeling of protection, of protecting
and being protected, an environment of human protection in
contact with this family, which stops being it as soon as
these shared ideals are broken. There is a notable
contrast between their love for their own people and their
disinterest for the rest of the world which does not fit
in their family ideal. On a deeper level, there is a
strong divide between what is loved and recognized and
what is aggressive and rejected, which may externally
manifest in living with a distinction of what is familial
and what is not.
La Mirada Libre's Self-Preservation 7 Description[9]
E7 Conservation: Family
This type is practical and earthy, not at all idealistic
or fanciful like the sexual and social ones. The 7
conservationists are called "family" because they create
bonds of mutual interest. Although, what they create is
more like a mafia than a family in the positive sense of
the word, and they do so for two reasons: to further their
interests, sweet tooth, and to repress the feeling of
lacking conservation that they have carried since
childhood.
This subtype is also called "the guardian of the castle"
(a cold and empty fortress) alluding to its schizoid
character: lack of transparency, communication, affection,
trust, as well as a tendency to emotional isolation,
radical autonomy, individualism and independence at all
costs (may be more tight-fisted emotionally than a
5).
They are affectionate with those in their environment and
profiteers with the rest of the universe, since they do
not trust in laws but in "blood" ties (mutually beneficial
agreements).
While he is dominated by narcissistic feelings, deep down
he feels the discomfort of inadequacy. He feels inferior
and envious, tending to feel "bad,” since he has become a
mercantilist child who values ​​affection according to
goods or services that others are capable of
providing.
A skillful manipulator by word and intellect (charlatan),
he cultivates complicity; and being as he is a rebel
without a cause, in a world that he sees as hostile and in
which it is better to take care of saving his skin and
enjoying himself, he has a predatory behavior that borders
on the lust of the 8, only stopped by his unconscious fear
of being punished and their "family" ties.
He loves rubbing shoulders with the "vips" because he
also has (to a greater or lesser extent) a poverty phobia
and places himself in positions where he shines through
the others without having to expose himself in the front
row, always from the role of "the one who knows". At the
same time, he likes to surround himself with beautiful
people, especially in relationships; he has a certain
obsession with beauty.
He likes to drag others into what he considers "the good
life" and to be heard and recognized (especially if he is
a man, by the woman) as a person who is in the know. Also,
like all 7, he has a great sense of humor, only the
conservation uses it quite often in the service of
antagonizing the other.
In short, he has a sadistic behavior in disguise and a
tendency to mistreat others while trying to appear
cordial. His frauds range from large business scams to
fraud and infidelity as a couple. Of the three subtypes,
conservation is intellectual-active.
